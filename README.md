## General Information

REVARZ is a streetwear e-store that offers a colorful and refreshing selection of the newest trends. Current selection includes 20 products from 4 manufacturers:

* Carhartt WIP
* Edwin
* RIPNDIP
* St√ºssy

---

The site is built keeping in mind the growing variety of products and brands to be featured on the catalogue meaning that the front-end and the back-end code are both scalable enough to handle an addition of brands and products to the database.

REVARZ offers the ability to browse the store to both users and guests.<br />
Checkouts and Cart related actions currently remain available only for registered users. 

This project is created for learning purposes but with some configurations the shop could be turned into a real working product.<br/>
