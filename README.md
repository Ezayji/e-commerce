## General Information

REVARZ is a streetwear e-store that offers a colorful and refreshing selection of the newest trends. Current selection includes 20 products from 4 manufacturers:

* Carhartt WIP
* Edwin
* RIPNDIP
* St√ºssy

---

The site is built keeping in mind the growing variety of products and brands to be featured on the catalogue meaning that the front-end and the back-end code are both scalable enough to handle an addition of brands and products to the database.

REVARZ offers the ability to browse the store to both users and guests.<br />
Checkouts and Cart related actions currently remain available only for registered users. 

This project is created for learning purposes but with a few configurations it could be turned into a working product.<br/>

**Note that because this is a demo, you shouldn't enter your real credit card information for testing payment functionality.**

Please use "dummy" credit cards provided in the [Checkout](#checkout) section instead.

      >$ cd .../e-commerce
      
      >$ npm install
      
      3. install the **front-end** packages.
      
      >$ cd /client
  
      >$ npm install
      
      4. Create a **PostgreSQL database** and insert the commands from **"e-commerce.sql"**.
      5. Create a **".env"** file in the **root directory** and add the following:
      ```
      SESSION_SECRET={Any randomly generated key or word}
      PG_USER={Your PostgreSQL user}
      PG_HOST=localhost

    #### Running Locally

      After a successful setup you can run the application using the following commands:

      * Run the **whole app**.
        ```
        $ npm run dev
        ```
        *The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)* 

      * Run only the **Front-End** .
        ```
        $ npm run client
        ```
        *The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)*
      * Run only the **Server**.
        ```
        $ npm run server
        ```
        *The app will be available at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)*
    ---

    #### Test Suites

    Server testing suite covers all the CRUD operations.<br/>
    Run the **Server** suite from the root directory:
    >Folder: e-commerce
    ```
    $ npm test
    ```

    The suite is located in:
    >e-commerce/tests/server-test.js
    
    There are also helper functions in a subfolder that help the suite with some PostgreSQL queries that need to be performed before some actions.

    

    ---

    **Front-End** testing suites cover the functionality of all components<br/>

    You can run the suites from the 'client' folder:
    >Folder: e-commerce/client
    ```
    $ npm test
    ```

    *note that stripe related actions were manually tested.*

---

  3. ### Status

      The current application state is suitable for demo use and supports the addition of products and brands.
      For real use, the server must also change stock quantity after a successful checkout which could be implemented by adding an extra query to the server payment confirmation route. Also the "forgot password" function should be implemented for real usage and e-mail confirmations should be sent after registering.

      Next steps for the demo:
      
      * Admin view.
      * OAuth login with Google. 

---

  4. ### Database

      Schema:

      ![Database Schema](https://i.imgur.com/q0gSPRl.png)

      * Each customer must have an unique id, username, email and phone. All columns except address related ones must be filled.

      * Cart items are tracked in the table "cart" with a foreign key "customer_username". 
  
      * Ordered items are tracked in the table "order_item" with a foreign key "shippment_id".

      * The server creates a shippment after a successful checkout and then the Front-End sends a "POST" request to convert tracked cart items to order items.
 
      * For the sake of demo use no quantity is removed from stock. That could be implemented by adding a query function to the server side payment confirmation route.

---

## Inspiration

This project was created as an assignement from Codecademy and inspired by the creative clothing brands featured in the catalogue.

It's a little step in my journey of becoming a real developer and this project could be improved a lot in the future.
