**PERN Stack E-Commerce Demo Store**<br/>

## General Information

REVARZ is a streetwear e-store that offers a colorful and refreshing selection of the newest trends. Current selection includes 20 products from 4 manufacturers:

* Carhartt WIP
* Edwin
* RIPNDIP
* St√ºssy

---

The site is built keeping in mind the growing variety of products and brands to be featured on the catalogue meaning that the front-end and the back-end code are both scalable enough to handle an addition of brands and products to the database.

This project is created for learning purposes but with some configurations the shop could be turned into a real working product.<br/>

     * Note that because this is a demo, you shouldn't enter your real credit card information for testing payment functionality. Please use "dummy" credit cards provided below instead. *
